## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The image cost ledger lost concurrent writes (`cost_tracker.py`).**
  `skills/banana/scripts/cost_tracker.py` read and wrote `~/.banana/costs.json` with no
  file locking on any platform and a non-atomic write, so two concurrent `log` calls both
  read the same ledger and the second silently overwrote the first. Measured 4 entries
  lost out of 20 concurrent `log` calls, with 3 of those processes crashing outright with
  `JSONDecodeError` after reading a half-written file. It is easy to miss because the
  ledger carries running aggregates (`total_cost`, `total_images`, `daily`) incremented
  in the same write as the entry, so a lost write drops both together and the file stays
  internally self-consistent while under-reporting. One exclusive lock now spans the
  entire read-modify-write in `log`.
- **No locking primitive is no longer treated as "proceed unlocked".** Locking uses
  `fcntl` on POSIX and falls back to `msvcrt` on Windows; when neither is importable the
  operation fails loudly instead of running unlocked.
- **Ledger writes are atomic** (`tempfile.mkstemp` plus `os.replace`), so a crash
  mid-write can no longer leave a truncated, unparseable ledger. A corrupt ledger now
  fails closed with an actionable message and the file left in place for inspection,
  instead of a bare traceback. `reset` takes the lock but deliberately does not read
  first, so it still works as the recovery path for a corrupt ledger.
- **`BANANA_HOME`** now overrides the ledger location, so the ledger's behaviour can be
  exercised without touching a real spend history.

- Added marketplace catalog (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) for distribution via `/plugin marketplace add`
- Moved `banana/` to `skills/banana/` (standard plugin layout)
- Moved `.claude/agents/` to `agents/` (standard plugin layout)
- Plugin install is now the primary installation method
- Updated CI workflow, README, CLAUDE.md, and install.sh for new structure

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-19

### Breaking Changes
- Removed `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro) -- shut down by Google March 9, 2026
- Replaced 6-component Reasoning Brief with Google's official 5-component formula (Subject → Action → Location/Context → Composition → Style)
- Default resolution changed from `1K` to `2K` in fallback scripts
- Banned prompt keywords: "8K", "masterpiece", "ultra-realistic", "high resolution" -- use prestigious context anchors instead

### Added
- Banned Keywords section in prompt-engineering.md (Stable Diffusion-era terms that degrade quality)
- Negative Prompts guidance (semantic reframing, ALL CAPS for constraints)
- Prompt Length Guide (20-60 words quick draft → 200-300 complex)
- Text Rendering section for Nano Banana 2
- Domain-to-model routing table in gemini-models.md
- Resolution defaults by domain mode
- Error response taxonomy in mcp-tools.md (429, 400 FAILED_PRECONDITION, IMAGE_SAFETY)
- Non-existent parameters warning in mcp-tools.md
- `.claude/agents/brief-constructor.md` subagent for prompt construction
- `CLAUDE.md` at repo root with development context and testing instructions
- Mandatory reference loading instruction at top of SKILL.md
- Full generation pipeline with retry logic and error handling in SKILL.md
- Exponential backoff retry logic (429 handling) in generate.py and edit.py
- FAILED_PRECONDITION billing error detection in fallback scripts
- Prestigious context anchors replacing banned quality keywords in all templates

### Changed
- SKILL.md version bumped to 1.4.0 with improved frontmatter
- gemini-models.md fully restructured with NB2/NB naming, updated pricing ($0.067/1K)
- Model routing table uses 5-component references instead of 6-component
- All prompt templates updated to use prestigious anchors instead of banned keywords
- Prompt adaptation rules updated to remove banned keywords

### Fixed
- gemini-3-pro-image-preview listed as "Active" when it was dead since March 9
- Pricing was stale ($0.039 for 3.1 Flash when actual is $0.067)
- Rate limits updated to reflect 92% cut (Free: ~5-15 RPM / ~20-500 RPD)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Multi-model routing** -- task-based model selection table (draft/standard/quality/text-heavy/batch)
- **Cost tracking** -- `cost_tracker.py` with log, summary, today, estimate, and reset commands
- **Direct API fallback** -- `generate.py` and `edit.py` scripts for when MCP is unavailable (stdlib only)
- **Brand/style presets** -- `presets.py` for reusable brand identities (colors, style, typography, lighting, mood)
- **CSV batch workflow** -- `batch.py` parses CSV files into generation plans with cost estimates
- **Green screen transparency pipeline** -- workaround for Gemini's lack of transparent backgrounds
- **Safety filter rephrase strategies** -- 5 rephrase patterns, common trigger categories, example rephrases
- Cost tracking reference (`references/cost-tracking.md`) with pricing table and free tier limits
- Brand presets reference (`references/presets.md`) with schema, 3 example presets, merge behavior
- Abstract domain mode added to README
- Step 1.5 (Check for Presets) in Creative Director pipeline
- `/banana preset` and `/banana cost` commands in Quick Reference
- Expanded error handling for MCP unavailable and safety filter false positives

### Changed
- Quality Presets section replaced with Model Routing table
- Pro model status updated: may still be accessible for image generation
- Pricing note: research suggests NB2 pricing may be ~$0.067/img
- Architecture diagram updated to show all 7 scripts and 6 references
- install.sh creates `~/.banana/` directory for cost tracking and presets

### Removed
- Legacy `nano-banana/scripts/__pycache__/` (orphaned .pyc files)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- 4K resolution output via `imageSize` parameter (512, 1K, 2K, 4K)
